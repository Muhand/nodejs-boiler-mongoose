# nodejs-boiler-mongoose
A nodejs boiler plate for mongoose. It doesn't include any architecture and this was done on purpose so architecture can be done per project basis. There will be different branches for different architectures however.

## TODO:
1. Add controller
2. Add cli boiler plate (maybe to a different branch)
3. Add `tests`
